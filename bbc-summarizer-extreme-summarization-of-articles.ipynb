'In Wales, councils are responsible for funding and overseeing schools.\\nBut in England, Mr Osborne\\'s plan will mean local authorities will cease to have a role in providing education.\\nAcademies are directly funded by central government and head teachers have more freedom over admissions and to change the way the school works.\\nIt is a significant development in the continued divergence of schools systems on either side of Offa\\'s Dyke.\\nAnd although the Welsh Government will get extra cash to match the money for English schools to extend the school day, it can spend it on any devolved policy area.\\nMinisters have no plans to follow suit.\\nAt the moment, governing bodies are responsible for setting school hours and they need ministerial permission to make significant changes.\\nThere are already more than 2,000 secondary academies in England and its extension to all state schools is unlikely to shake the Welsh Government\\'s attachment to what they call a \"community, comprehensive model\" for schools.\\nIt rejects claims that freedom given to academies can help drive up standards, and it points to academy-free Scotland as the best performing school system in the UK.\\nEducation Minister Huw Lewis said there was \"very little evidence to suggest\" academies have a positive impact in driving up standards and Wales would not be following the model.\\n\"The Tories have wasted hundreds of millions of pounds on academies and free schools and as the Chancellor finalises his budget plans to slash vital services even further, he is committing them to wasting even more on a failing endeavour.\\n\"We have no plans to introduce the chaos and waste of academies and free schools here in Wales.\"\\nNone of the main parties in May\\'s Assembly election - including the Welsh Conservatives - have said they want to introduce academies in Wales.\\nOwen Hathway, NUT Cymru\\'s policy officer, called the academy plans for England \"scandalous.\".\\n\"There is no evidence that academies work, no evidence that they raise standards, no evidence that they offer better quality education and no evidence that they are what parents and communities want,\" he said.\\n\"Certainly a commitment to comprehensive education is something we would want, and indeed expect, all parties to hold firm to in their manifestos for the forthcoming Welsh election.\"\\nBut the Welsh and English schools systems are still linked by a joint arrangement for teachers\\' pay and conditions.\\nAcademies are not tied to these pay scales so in effect Wednesday\\'s announcement will take all English schools out of the system and raise questions about the viability of an England and Wales pay and conditions structure.\\nThere is already growing momentum for the devolution of teachers\\' pay and conditions.\\nOriginally sceptical, the Welsh Labour Government is now broadly in favour.\\nSome teaching unions remain opposed because of concern that Welsh teachers would end up being paid less than those in England.\\nMr Hathway said teachers were concerned it could lead to regional pay.\\n\"At the same time we do of course recognise that the issue of pay is already becoming a grey area due to the negative changes we see taking place in England,\" he said.\\nBut an even bigger difference between the schools landscape on either side of the border, appears to make separate arrangements for pay increasingly likely in future.',\n 'summary': 'As Chancellor George Osborne announced all English state schools will become academies,

Children and young people may be victim of repeated rapes, physical assaults or grooming offences and we categorise all of these in crime recording.\"\nHe added: \"But what is most important here is our focus on identifying who these victims are.\n\"Our focus is always on where there are child protection issues, and on keeping children safe.\"\nMartin Crewe, director of Barnardo's Scotland, said: \"Rotherham was a real wake-up call and led to the Scottish government's national action plan last year but we could and should be doing more.\n\"Our concern is that we don't know the full extent of the problem. We welcome the work of the police.\n\"Since the publication of the Barnardo's Scotland petition in 2011 we have been pushing for a better understanding of child sexual exploitation in Scotland.\"\nIn January 2013, Aileen Campbell, Minister for Children and Young People, responded to the Public Petitions Committee inquiry into Child Sexual Exploitation in Scotland, and announced four points including, action \"to improve the way child sexual exploitation is identified by Scotland's new single police force to make this form of abuse more visible\".\nHowever, sexual exploitation per se is still not recorded or centrally collated.\nThe Scottish government said figures are available on the wider problem of child abuse.\nA spokeswoman said: \"The safety of our children is a key priority for the government and an issue we take extremely seriously.\n\"The launch of the National Child Abuse Investigation Unit will help to target and bring to justice those who seek to harm our young people.\n\"The unit has been set up to tackle all forms of child abuse, and child sexual exploitation is one aspect of this. We have robust legislation in place to cover a wide range of these offences, including online abuse and are working to strengthen the law even further.\"\nShe added: \"The extent of the problem is often difficult to assess because abuse by its very nature is concealed. That's why prevention and swift action to safeguard children are a big part of our strategy to tackle these terrible crimes.\n\"This includes robust National Child Protection guidance, action to tackle emerging forms of child abuse including child sexual exploitation, a national public awareness campaign and guidance for night-time workers such as taxi drivers and hotel staff who may come into contact with those at risk.\"'\n\n'>>> Reference_summary: Police Scotland has said that it does not collate or hold specific figures on child sexual exploitation.'\n\n'>>> Generated_summary: Police in Scotland do not keep detailed data on child sexual exploitation, the BBC has learned.'\n","output_type":"stream"}]}]}
